- check ident works correctly
- in extra tests negation shouldn't work but is in good tests
- maxbound

- stdin program
- div zero
- check return value
- check all types of errors print to stderr
- checkk all tyesp of errors return non zeor val

# change

- change max and min int values

- Should I change grammar or change test for negatives of the form `int a = - -5;`
- Same for loogical not
- infinite loop ok?


- multiplying to int larger than int_max is undefined behaviour for now
- if else type mismathc even if false for a branch
- should error be equivalent to ret
